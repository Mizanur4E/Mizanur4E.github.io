Welcome to my site. Thanks for having a look!
I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) in Nanoelectronics Research Lab led by Professor Azad J. Naeemi, GaTech, USA. 
Being an engineer, my liability is to analyze in detail the core problems the human civilization is facing and apply state-of-the-art knowledge to provide a green solution. I am highly interested in working with both algorithm and hardware-level approaches to accelerate the artificial intelligence sector.
