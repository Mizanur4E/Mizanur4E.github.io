Welcome to my portfolio website. Thank you for taking the time to visit!

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in the Nanoelectronics Research Lab under the guidance of Professor Azad J. Naeemi at Georgia Tech, USA.

My research focuses on novel computing hierarchies to support next-generation AI applications. This includes the integration of emerging memory devices for domain-specific and heterogeneous computing, as well as the optimization of existing digital ML hardware accelerators. My work spans from memory array-level macro design to architecture-level simulation and optimization.

My goal is to be at the forefront of technological innovation, contributing to the development of solutions that not only address current challenges but also pave the way for a more sustainable and intelligent future.
