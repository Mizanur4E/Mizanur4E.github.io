I am a Ph.D. student in the Nanoelectronics Research Lab at Georgia Tech, working under the supervision of Professor Azad J. Naeemi.

My research is dedicated to pioneering novel computing hierarchies that advance next-generation AI applications. I focus on integrating emerging memory devices to enable domain-specific and heterogeneous computing, alongside optimizing digital ML hardware accelerators. My work spans from macro design at the memory array level to architecture-level simulation and optimization.

I am driven by a passion for technological innovation, aiming to develop solutions that not only address current challenges but also lay the groundwork for a more sustainable and intelligent future.
